# Projects
Some code projects I have been working on using javascript, p5.js, and Java

If you download the Bowman Legends file, you can run the .html file on firefox or on a local server. This is the most up to date version. An older verion can be viewed at http://students.purchase.edu/nicholas.feuer/games/newArrow.html.

SnakeServer is my final project that uses node.js and p5.js. See https://github.com/nfeuer/SnakeServer.git for most up to date repository. The project is deployed at http://spazsnake.herokuapp.com/.
