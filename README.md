# Projects
Some code projects I have been working on using javascript, p5.js, and Java.

One of my final projects, SnakeServer uses node.js and p5.js. See https://github.com/nfeuer/SnakeServer.git for most up to date repository. The project is deployed at http://spazsnake.herokuapp.com/.

If you download the Bowman Legends file, you can run the .html file on firefox or on a local server. It can be viewed at http://students.purchase.edu/nicholas.feuer/games/newArrow.html. Click, drag, and release to fire arrow. First to two hits wins.
