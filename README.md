# Projects
Some code projects I have been working on using javascript, p5.js, and Java

If you download the Bowman Legends file, you can run the html file on firefox or on a local server.

SnakeServer is a final project I am currently working on that uses node.js. Eventually should play similar to Twitch Plays Pokemon.
